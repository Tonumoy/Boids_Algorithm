# Boids Algorithm Simulation


## Description
This project simulates the Boids algorithm, demonstrating the complex flocking behavior of birds. By implementing rules of separation, alignment, and cohesion, it visualizes how individual agents can create emergent patterns through simple interactions.

## Installation
To set up the "Boids Algorithm Simulation" project, clone the repository and install the necessary Python packages:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the simulation, execute the Jupyter notebook:

```
jupyter notebook Boids_Algorithm.ipynb
```

Within the notebook, you can adjust parameters to see how they affect the flocking behavior.

Include a screenshot of the simulation here to provide a visual example of what the algorithm does.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the simulation or extend its features are very welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
